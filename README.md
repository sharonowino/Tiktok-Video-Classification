# TikTok Video Classification

## Introduction

TikTok, a popular social media platform, faces a significant challenge in managing user reports that identify videos and comments containing user claims. These reports require timely review by moderators, but the large volume of submissions creates a backlog, making it difficult to prioritize them efficiently.

## Project Goal

The **main objective** for undertaking this project is to build a predictive model that aims to classify videos into "claim" or "opinion" categories to help TikTok moderators prioritize user reports more efficiently.

## Project Background

The project is in its initial stages of claims classification, focusing on conducting extensive **Exploratory Data analysis (EDA)**.
**Key objectives include:**
1. Gathering descriptive statistics and understanding data distributions for various features.
2. Examining relationships and factors that influence the target class (claim or opinion).
3. Creating visual plots to visualize variables and explore relationships between them.
4. Identifying outliers within the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The **goal** is to further explore the dataset and create visualizations.

  **This activity has 4 parts:**
*   **Part 1:** Imports, links, and loading
*   **Part 2:** Data Exploration
    *    Data inspect and analyse
    *    Data cleaning
*   **Part 3:** Build visualizations
*   **Part 4:** Evaluate and share results
